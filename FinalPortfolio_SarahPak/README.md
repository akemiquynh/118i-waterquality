## Overview
A 24/7 multilingual virtual assistant that helps households understand their local water quality and find the best water filtration solutions based on their unique needs and budgets. Whether you're concerned about contaminants, unsure about which filter to buy, or want to understand your water better, our assistant provides easy-to-understand answers and recommendations.

## AquaEd: How does it work?
The name AquaEd reflects the assistant's core purpose and that's to educate and guide users through the complex world of water quality and purification. The assistant focuses on three major areas of exploration:
* Local Water Quality: Understand what's in your tap water based on your ZIP code.
* Health & Safety: Learn how specific contaminants may impact your health.
* Personalized Solutions: Get customized filter recommendations based on your concerns, household setup, and budget.

## Why AquaEd?
Millions of households in the United States rely on tap water that may contain harmful contaminants. While there are tools and reports available, they're often difficult to interpret. Furthermore, the sheer number of filtration options makes it overwhelming for consumers to choose the right solution.
Key Challenges:
* EPA Reports are technical and hard to read.
* Many filter review sites are biased or confusing.
* Most consumers don't know what contaminants are actually in their water.
* Non-English speakers have even fewer resources.

AquaEd was built to change that. Our virtual assistant provides:
* Water quality insights by ZIP code, using EPA and EWG data.
* Plain-language explanations of contaminants and health risks.
* Filter recommendations that match the user's water quality issues, household size, and budget.
* Information in multiple languages (English, Spanish, Mandarin, Vietnamese, and Korean).
* Charts, visuals, and downloadable PDFs for easy sharing or offline reference.

## Our Solution
We developed a Streamlit-based chatbot powered by OpenAI and water quality databases. The assistant acts as a personal water consultant for every household, offering:
* Location-based Reports: Pulls synthetic or real-time contaminant data based on the user's ZIP code.
* Educational Insights: Translates EPA contaminant descriptions into user-friendly language.
* Tailored Filter Suggestions: Matches filters from trusted review sources to specific water issues.
* Visual Experience: Interactive charts, clickable product cards, and downloadable reports.
* Multilingual Support: Full functionality available in 5 major languages.
